The ecosystem consists of several types of objects: an orb in the center, 
plants that grow outwards from the orb, creatures, and spores. The ecosystem is
enclosed in an outer ring. Users interact with the game in this ring. Each of 
the objects and the interactions between them are described below.  

* The ecosystem is divided into three circular 'depth' zones. The first zone
  is closest to the orb. The third zone is closest to the outer ring. 
  
* The outer ring is where the users interact with the game.

* All objects in the game are bounded by the outer ring. This means they cannot 
  move into the outer ring. Only spores can move through the outer ring. The 
  spore behavior will be detailed below. 

* A small orb, or seed, lies at the heart of the ecosystem.

* Plants grow outwards from the orb. 

* Creatures move around the orb, in between the plants. 

* The creatures and the plant collide, which means the creatures cause the plant
  to move.
  
* There is only one type of creature per ecosystem. This creature has several
  evolutionary stages, but each creature in the ecosystem starts out in the 
  first stage.

* A creature has three evolutionary stages. Creatures in the first stage are
  bound to the first depth zone, etc.

* When a user puts their hand down on the outer ring, energy starts building up
  around it. After X seconds this energy is beamed into the orb in the middle
  of the ecosystem. 

* When the energy beam from the hand reaches the orb, the orb grows in size.

* Multiple users can put their hands down at the same time. This makes the orb
  grow even bigger in size.
  
* Energy particles, or spores, are emitted from the orb at a frequency dependent 
  on the orb's size. When no user interacts with the game, no spores are emitted
  at all, and the ecosystem does not grow.
  
* The spores are emitted much like the ripples in a pond. This means the spores
  are emitted in bursts. The frequency with which the bursts occur depends on
  the orb's size.

* When a spore hits one of the most outward branches of the plant, a new branch
  grows from the tip of the branch that was hit.
  
* When a spore hits a creature the creature grows in size. When a creature has
  grown big enough, it reaches its next evolutionary stage. The creatures have
  a different visual look for each evolutionary stage.
  
* All creatures in the ecosystem start in the first stage of their evolution.

* When a creature reaches its next stage, it moves to the next depth zone.

* When a spore hits a creature in the third zone, the spore is removed, but the
  creature does not grow any more.

* Creatures in the third zone, and therefore in their third evolutionary stage,
  flock towards where users have put their hands down.
  
* Creatures in the third zone block the energy beam that flows from the hands to
  the orb. This stops the energy beam from reaching the orb.

* Creatures, in all zones, exhibit a light erratic flocking behavior, but only 
  if they're not targeting a hand. 

* When a hand is detected, the two creatures that are closest to it, and are not 
  targeting a hand already, are set to target the hand. The other creatures 
  follow because of their flocking behavior.
  
* Creatures aggressively target the hands (they react quickly and move fast).

* The spores that don't hit any object in the ecosystem move through the outer 
  ring and reach the other tables from the outside.
